# Machine-Learning-Dummy_Variables
A repository explaining about the use and declaration of Dummy Variables.
One hot encoding is used in regression models following label encoding. This enables us to create new attributes according to the number of classes present in the categorical attribute i.e if there are n number of categories in categorical attribute, n new attributes will be created. These attributes created are called Dummy Variables.
